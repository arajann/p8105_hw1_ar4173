Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(23)

race_df = tibble(
  acceleration_kmh = rnorm(10),
  positive_ac= c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE),
  names = c("Michael","Bodie","Mcnulty","Poot", "Avon","WeeBey", "Omar","Stringer","Marlo","Lestor"),
  pace = factor(c("moderate","slow", "moderate", "fast", "moderate", "fast","slow","fast","moderate","fast"))
)

race_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    acceleration_kmh positive_ac names    pace    
    ##               <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>   
    ##  1           0.193  TRUE        Michael  moderate
    ##  2          -0.435  FALSE       Bodie    slow    
    ##  3           0.913  TRUE        Mcnulty  moderate
    ##  4           1.79   TRUE        Poot     fast    
    ##  5           0.997  TRUE        Avon     moderate
    ##  6           1.11   TRUE        WeeBey   fast    
    ##  7          -0.278  FALSE       Omar     slow    
    ##  8           1.02   TRUE        Stringer fast    
    ##  9           0.0454 TRUE        Marlo    moderate
    ## 10           1.58   TRUE        Lestor   fast

``` r
mean(race_df$acceleration_kmh)
```

    ## [1] 0.6931617

``` r
mean(race_df$positive_ac)
```

    ## [1] 0.8

``` r
mean(race_df$names)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(race_df$names): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(race_df$pace)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(race_df$pace): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean could be taken of both the acceleration\_kmh and postive\_ac
variables. However, for the character and factor vectors (names and
pace), we were unable to take the mean.

``` r
as.numeric(positive_ac)
```

Using this function converts the True/False elements in the positive\_ac
vector into numbers 0 and 1( Zero for False, One for ). Thus it explains
why we get a mean for the logical vector, even though the elements are
not in fact numeric.

Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

The data gives descriptions of 344 different penguins using 8 variables.
Each observation is assigned a species, sex, and the island the penguin
is from. Moreover, the continuous variables of the data set measures the
bill length, bill depth, and flipper length(in millimeters). The year
variable I presume is the year the penguinâ€™s data was taken/marked.

``` r
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm=TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

After reviewing the dataset, there are missing values, particularly for
observations 343 and 344. To calculate the mean flipper length of the
penguins in the sample, we ommitted those two observations. After
ommission, the mean flipper length is 200.9152 millimeters.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x= bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

![](p8105_HW_ar4173_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

A scatter plot was created comparing the bill length to the flipper
length, and the colors of the points denote what species each penguin
observation is. The key is given to the right of the generated scatter
plot. The scatter plot reveals a fairly linear relationship between bill
length and flipper length.

``` r
ggsave("penguins.png",plot=last_plot())
```
