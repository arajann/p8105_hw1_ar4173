Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

The data gives descriptions of 344 different penguins using 8 variables.
Each observation is assigned a species, sex, and the island the penguin
is from. Moreover, the continuous variables of the data set measures the
bill length, bill depth, and flipper length(in millimeters). The year
variable I presume is the year the penguinâ€™s data was taken/marked.

``` r
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm=TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

After reviewing the dataset, there are missing values, particularly for
observations 343 and 344. To calculate the mean flipper length of the
penguins in the sample, we ommitted those two observations. After
ommission, the mean flipper length is 200.9152 millimeters.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x= bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + geom_point()
```

A scatter plot was created comparing the bill length to the flipper
length, and the colors of the points denote what species each penguin
observation is. The key is given to the right of the generated scatter
plot. The scatter plot reveals a fairly linear relationship between bill
length and flipper length.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
